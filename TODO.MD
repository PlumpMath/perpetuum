# TODO List for Perpetuum

<img alt="Perpetuum Mobile" src="image/240px-PerpetuumMobile.gif" style="float: right;"/>

  * DONE: Welcome the `xmlns` in the `<pnml/>` top-level elements of input files
  * DONE: .pkey and .tkey are now printed in order, but note: count from 1
  * DONE: Process multiplicity on arcs, through the arc/inscription/text form
  * DONE: Allow for events from the environment
  * DONE: Cause actions to be called in the environment
  * HACK: Build a Perpetuum library holding the generic code
  * HACK: Support more individual generation with the compiler; not just demos
